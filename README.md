# ProjetLong

Student project : Introduction to computational neuroscience and modeling.

The main goal of this project is to determine if, using the Postnov equations for the synapse, basic neuron equations are enough to draw conclusions on the impact of astrocyte calcium on epileptical seizures. We used Brian2 to compute our system, and we referred to Postnov and AdEx models \cite{adex}. From a first tripartite synapse analysis, we conclude that the Postnov model coupled with the AdEx model  allows accounting for the main synaptic dynamics, in particular the role of the astrocyte on synaptic regulation. We then investigate a new toy model to study astrocyte calcium's feedback on the presynaptic neuron. Finally, we created a basic neuron network with one astrocyte to start discussing their impact on an higher scale and larger distances.
